* sugar

Some syntactical sugar for R.

** Appending objects to lists
   
   Assume we have an list and some objects we want to be named parts
   of this list.

#+begin_src R
  mylist <- list()
  numbers <- 1:20
  breakfast <- "chunky bacon"
  wood <- list(oak = "hard", spruce = "soft")
#+end_src

   In R, you usually do

#+begin_src R
  mylist$numbers <- numbers
#+end_src

   to append a single object to this list. The same thing has to be
   done for multiple objects:

#+begin_src R
  mylist$breakfast <- breakfast
  mylist$wood <- wood
#+end_src
   
   The sugar provided shortens this to:

#+begin_src R
  mylist %$% numbers
#+end_src
   
   for the case of appending a single object, and for multiple
   objects to:

#+begin_src R
  mylist %$% c(breakfast, wood)
#+end_src

   This is achieved using global assignment, so be careful when using
   this non-interactively.

** Loading multiple packages with one call

   Instead of

#+begin_src R
  library(utils)
  library(mgcv)
  library(sp)
#+end_src

   We can do

#+begin_src R
  libraries(utils, mgcv, sp)
#+end_src
